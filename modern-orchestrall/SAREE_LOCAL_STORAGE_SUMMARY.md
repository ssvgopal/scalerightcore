# Saree Demo Implementation - Local Storage Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

I have successfully modified the saree demo backend to use **local file storage** instead of AWS S3, making it much easier to run and test without external dependencies.

## What Changed

### 1. Storage Service Refactored
- **Before**: AWS S3 with signed URLs and complex dependencies
- **After**: Local file storage with simple public URLs
- **Benefits**: No AWS credentials required, easier testing, faster setup

### 2. Updated Configuration
- **Local Storage**: `STORAGE_PATH=./uploads` and `ASSET_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/uploads`
- **AWS S3**: Still available for production via environment variables
- **Backward Compatible**: Interface remains the same for easy migration

### 3. File Organization
```
uploads/
└── saree/
    └── {assetId}/
        ├── source.jpg
        ├── tryon/
        │   ├── 1.jpg
        │   ├── 2.jpg
        │   └── ...
        ├── video/
        │   └── demo.mp4
        └── depth/
            ├── depth.png
            └── normals.png
```

### 4. Testing Verified
- ✅ URL validation works (kankatala.com allowed, malicious URLs blocked)
- ✅ File upload/download operations work
- ✅ Directory creation and cleanup
- ✅ Public URL generation
- ✅ All unit tests pass

## How to Use

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the application
npm start
```

### 2. Test the API
```bash
# Test local storage
node test-local-storage.js

# Run unit tests
npm test tests/unit/saree-storage.test.js
```

### 3. Use the Demo
```bash
# Ingest a saree image
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/demo/saree/ingest \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"productImageUrl": "https://kankatala.com/products/saree.jpg"}'

# Generate try-on images
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/demo/saree/tryon \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"assetId": "YOUR_ASSET_ID", "avatarSpec": {"skinTone": "medium", "pose": "front"}}'
```

## Security Features Maintained
- ✅ URL allowlist prevents SSRF attacks
- ✅ JWT authentication with existing auth system
- ✅ Input validation with Zod schemas
- ✅ File path validation and sanitization
- ✅ Error handling and logging

## Production Ready
When you're ready to deploy to production:
1. Set `STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3` in environment
2. Configure AWS credentials (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`)
3. Set `ASSET_BASE_URL` to your CDN URL
4. The code will automatically switch to S3 storage

## Demo URLs
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:3000/docs
- **Static Files**: http://localhost:3000/uploads/
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:3000/health

The implementation is now **production-ready** with local storage for easy development and testing, while maintaining full compatibility with cloud storage for production deployments.
